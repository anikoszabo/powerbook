The responses from a subject are summarized with a T-score, which has a mean 50 and standard deviation of 10 in the US general population. An investigator wants to study anxiety in the population of patients with cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) using the PROMIS Anxiety scale to see if they report more anxiety (ie higher T-scores on the scale) than the general population.
